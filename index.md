##  Preface
People like fast sites. Loading time has been a major contributing factor to page abandonment.

The current web has evolved a lot in past decade from viewing static site to playing AAA 3D games in browser. Search engine like Google also rank websites on the basis of site speed. In the study "The Need for Mobile Speed" it was found that 53% of mobile site visits are abandoned is the page took longer than 3 seconds to load. Another research showed a 2 second delay during transaction resulted in shopping cart abandonment rates upto 87%. So there is a constant need in making the web faster and easier accessible to everyone.

This book tries to showcases real world trends and practices to improve the performance of website and webapps.
