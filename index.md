# Introduction
The current web has evolved a lot in past decade from viewing static site to playing AAA 3D games in browser. Over 4.33 billion people were active internet users as of July 2019. In this over growing economy website visibility and high conversion rates is highly important. Search engine like Google among various other criteria also rank websites on the basis of site speed. In the study "The Need for Mobile Speed" it was found that 53% of mobile site visits are abandoned if the page took longer than 3 seconds to load. Another research showed a 2 second delay during transaction resulted in shopping cart abandonment rates upto 87% and 79% shoppers dissatisfied with website performance are less likely to buy from the same site again.

A 1 second delay in page response can result in a 7% reduction in conversion [ If an e-commerce site is making $100K per day, a mere 1 second could potentially cost $2,500,000 in lost sales every year]. So there is a constant need in making the web faster and easier accessible to everyone.

# Images
A picture is worth thousand of words. According to the HTTP Archive, 60% of the data transferred to fetch a web page is images composed of JPEGs, PNGs and GIFs. As of July 2017, images accounted approximately 0.45MB of the content loaded for every 1.0MB average site.

Image optimization consists of:
* Choosing Right Format
* Proper Resizing
* Image Compression
* Lazy Loading
* Priority Fetching and Caching
